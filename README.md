# Largest Companies Data Science Project

This project is a university-level implementation that combines data analysis and machine learning using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It is divided into two main components:

1. A Jupyter Notebook for structured data exploration and visualization using OOP principles.
2. A Streamlit-based graphical interface (GUI app) to predict company success probability using a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of the world's 100 largest companies by market capitalization. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and prediction of the companyâ€™s success probability based on financial and categorical attributes like revenue, employees, sector, and country.

## Objectives

- Apply Object-Oriented Programming to structure a data science workflow.
- Perform statistical analysis and visualizations of real-world financial data.
- Build a trained machine learning model (SVM) for predicting success probability.
- Deploy a user-friendly GUI using Streamlit for model interaction.

## Project Components

### 1. Jupyter Notebook: OOP-Based Data Analysis

**File:** `projectoop.ipynb`

#### Description

This notebook encapsulates the entire data analysis process in a class-based structure using OOP. It allows for clean, reusable, and maintainable code when exploring and visualizing data.

#### Functionalities

- Load dataset
- Show sample records
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Plot histograms of numerical columns
- Plot heatmaps of feature correlations

#### Main Class: `CompanyData`

```python
class CompanyData:
    def __init__(self, file_path)
    def explore_data(self, n=5)
    def data_statistics(self)
    def plot_histogram(self, column)
    def plot_heatmap(self)
